Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase various projects developed during my master's studies in Business Analytics at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). Throughout my coursework and research, I have focused on applying statistical learning, time series forecasting, and network analysis to solve complex data-driven problems.
